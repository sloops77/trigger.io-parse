``parse``: Push notifications with Parse
====================================

["Add a Backend to Your Mobile App in Minutes"](https://parse.com/) - allows you to add backend features to
your mobile app without a server. Their back-end features include a datastore, user accounts and push notifications.

For a small example on our blog, see [Using Parse and Trigger.io for cross-platform apps without pain in the
back-end](http://trigger.io/cross-platform-application-development-blog/2012/03/23/using-parse-and-trigger-io-for-cross-platform-apps-without-pain-in-the-back-end/).

Parse push notifications are integrated directly Forge. Other Parse features may be accessed by using [forge.request.ajax](/modules/request/current/docs/index.html#forgerequestajaxoptions) with the [Parse REST API](https://parse.com/docs/rest).

> ::Important:: Following the acquisition of Parse by Facebook, you will also need to include the [facebook](/modules/facebook) module to compile your app with version `2.3` or newer of this module.


##Config options

applicationId
:   An application ID from [parse.com](https://parse.com/).

clientKey
:   A client key from [parse.com](https://parse.com/).

delayRegistration
:	Don't register for remote notifications at app startup (iOS Only)

###Android

Update Notifications
:    Update notifications on Android using the Inbox Style. This option also suppresses notification display on Android while the app is visible.  [More information.](https://blog.safaribooksonline.com/2012/08/29/android-4-1-jelly-bean-notifications/)

Notification Icon
:	Choose `icon` to use the app icon or `custom_push_icon` to use a custom icon for notifications.

24, 36, 48, 72, 96
:	Paths to the icons used if you have enabled a custom push notification icon.


##Concepts

> ::Important:: In order to use this module you'll need to register an app at [parse.com](https://parse.com/).

Push notifications received through Parse can be used with the generic
push notification event in Forge, see the [event API](/docs/current/api/core/event.html) for
more details. The following code is an example of how to show an alert
to a user when a push notification is received.

**Example**:

    forge.event.messagePushed.addListener(function (msg) {
        alert(msg.alert);
    });

You can try out sending a push notification from your app's control
panel at [parse.com](https://parse.com).

Parse uses channels to send push notifications to specific groups of
users. By default all users are subscribed to the empty channel; if you
wish to send push notifications to specific users, you can use the
following methods to manage which channels a user is subscribed to.


##API

!method: forge.parse.installationInfo(success, error)
!param: success `function(info)` called if the request is successful: ``info`` will contain at least an ``id`` entry
!description: Every Parse installation has a unique ID associated with it; you can use this method to retrieve the installation ID for this user and do things like [advanced targeting of push notifications](https://parse.com/docs/push_guide#sending-queries/REST).
!platforms: iOS, Android
!param: error `function(content)` called with details of any error which may occur

**Example**:

    forge.parse.installationInfo(function (info) {
        forge.logging.info("installation: "+JSON.stringify(info));
    });

!method: forge.parse.push.subscribe(channel, success, error)
!param: channel `string` identifier of the channel to subscribe to
!param: success `function()` called if the request is successful
!description: Subscribe to a channel to receive push notifications.
!platforms: iOS, Android
!param: error `function(content)` called with details of any error which may occur

**Example**:

    forge.parse.push.subscribe("beta-testers",
    function () {
      forge.logging.info("subscribed to beta-tester push notifications!");
    },
    function (err) {
      forge.logging.error("error subscribing to beta-tester notifications: "+
        JSON.stringify(err));
    });

!method: forge.parse.push.unsubscribe(channel, success, error)
!param: channel `string` identifier of the channel to unsubscribe from
!param: success `function()` called if the request is successful
!description: Un-subscribe from a channel to stop receiving push notifications.
!platforms: iOS, Android
!param: error `function(content)` called with details of any error which may occur

**Example**:

    forge.parse.push.unsubscribe("beta-testers",
    function () {
      forge.logging.info("no more beta-tester notifications...");
    },
    function (err) {
      forge.logging.error("couldn't unsubscribe from beta-tester notifications: "+
        JSON.stringify(err));
    });

!method: forge.parse.push.subscribedChannels(success, error)
!param: success `function(channels)` called with an array of subscribed channels
!description: Query subscribed channels.
!platforms: iOS, Android
!param: error `function(content)` called with details of any error which may occur

**Example**:

    forge.parse.push.subscribedChannels(
    function (channels) {
      forge.logging.info("subscribed to: "+JSON.stringify(channels));
    },
    function (err) {
      forge.logging.error("couldn't retrieve subscribed channels: "+
        JSON.stringify(err));
    });

> ::Important:: In previous verions of Forge, the parse module was exposed as ``forge.partners.parse``.
To ease transition to v2 of Forge, ``forge.partners.parse`` is an alias of ``forge.parse``. However use of 
the ``forge.partners.parse`` form is deprecated and should be changed to just ``forge.parse``.

!method: forge.parse.setBadgeNumber(number, success, error)
!param: number `integer` number
!param: success `function()` callback to be invoked when no errors occur
!description: Updates your badge count on the Parse server and sets or removes a badge for your app's icon on the iOS home screen.
!platforms: iOS
!param: error `function(content)` called with details of any error which may occur

> ::Note:: If you pass in 0 as number, it will remove this badge. This is
particularly useful if you want to clear a badge set by a push
notification.

!method: forge.parse.getBadgeNumber(success, error)
!param: success `function(number)` called if the request is successful. ``number`` contains the current badge count for your app.
!description: Returns the badge count registered for your app on the Parse server.
!platforms: iOS
!param: error `function(content)` called with details of any error which may occur

!method: forge.parse.registerForNotifications(success, error)
!param: success Called if the request is successful. 
!description: When used in conjunction with the config option `delayRegistration` this function can be used to delay the appearance of the notifications confirmation dialog until such time as this function is called rather than the first time the app is run.
!platforms: iOS
!param: error `function(content)` called with details of any error which may occur

**Example**:

	forge.parse.registerForNotifications(function () {
	  // iOS users have now received the push notifications permission alert
	}, function (err) {
	  forge.logging.error("Failed to register for notifications: " +
		JSON.stringify(err));
	});

> ::Important:: Instructions for resetting the push notifications permission alert on iOS can be found in ["Technical Note 2265"](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/technotes/tn2265/_index.html)

##Permissions

On Android this module will add the ``VIBRATE`` and
``RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED`` permissions to your app, users will be
prompted to accept this when they install your app.
